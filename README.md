## A quick note:

* This website is my first exercise project using a significant amount of JavaScript on GitHub and on the internet for that matter.  
* I've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL to develop the front and back end, keeping a clean modern design aesthetic in mind.  
* My work was made easier by using Bootstrap for the designing part.
* Your feedback would be highly appreciated! Feel free to get in touch using the contact details on my GitHub profile.

## License?

None. Feel free to use the project files as a template for your own assignment projects (not for the hiring process at Insider itself of course)!
